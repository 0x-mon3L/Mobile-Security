Application is making a call to the realtime database while querying the database. So in order to know what that database it, we will have to decompile/reverse-engineer the application & read it code to find out the name of the **Realtime Database**.

Most of the time, if the application's database is located over the network mostly on cloud, then it is possible that Firebase Database will come into the picture. 


The Firebase Realtime Database isÂ **a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets organizations store and sync data in real time across all of their users' devices**. This makes it easy to build apps that are always up to date, even when users are offline.

We will have to look for the Database url which is most likely to be found in /**Resources**/**resources.arsc**/**res**/**values**/**strings.xml** file.

Visiting the URL followed by `.json` reveals some data.
