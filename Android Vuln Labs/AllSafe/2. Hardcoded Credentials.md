For this task, we have to identify the Credentials which are Hardcoded inside the application. For that, we have to reverse engineer the application.

Open the application in JADX. Under **infosecadventures.allsafe**/**challenges**/**HardcodedCredentials**, we get our 1st set of credentials.

For 2nd set of credentials, scroll a little bit down & click on `onclick` method, we will see that `string` variable is declared calling the `dev_env`.

To view the content of `dev_env`, navigate to /**Resources**/**resources.arsc**/**res**/**values**/**strings.xml** and search for dev_env.
